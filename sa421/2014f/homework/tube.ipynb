      "Transport for London (TfL) has asked you to study the feasibility of replacing the manned ticket offices with automated ticket machines in its underground stations. \n",
      "As a pilot study, TfL wants you to focus on the evening rush hour period, from 16:00 to 20:00, at a very small station with 1 employee at the ticket office, which will be replaced with 1 machine.\n",

      "Using historical data provided to you, you have determined that the time between customers arrivals at the ticket office/machine is exponentially distributed with a mean of 3.2 minutes. \n",
      "In addition, you have determined using this data that the service time (in minutes) at the manned ticket office can be modeled with a Gamma random variable with shape parameter 2 and scale parameter 1.3. \n",
