      "The Simplexville Emergency Dispatch receives urgent calls for the police and fire departments in Simplexville, as well as for neighboring towns Bellman and Fulkerson. 65% of the calls are from Simplexville, 20% of the calls are from Bellman, and 15% of the calls are from Fulkerson. The dispatch prioritizes calls by the location of the call: Simplexville calls get the highest priority, then Bellman, and then Fulkerson. Calls arrive according to an exponential interarrival distribution with a mean of 3.2 minutes. The time that a call requires is also exponentially distributed, with a mean of 11.3 minutes. There are always 4 operators on duty at the dispatch.\n",
