    "**Problem.** Fantastic Dan has decided to add two more seats in the waiting area of his shop, raising the total number of seats in the waiting area to 5. Any customers who arrive when the shop is full still leave without receiving service. In addition, with your help, Fantastic Dan has determined that the customer reneging time is not deterministic; instead, it can be modeled as an exponential random variable with mean 22 minutes.\n",

    "Modify the SimPy code below to reflect these changes in Fantastic Dan's shop. Assume an 8 hour day. Run your simulation once. What fraction of customers balked? What fraction of customers reneged? Compare your numbers to the ones we obtained above in the earlier simulations. Do they make sense?"
