    "Transport for London (TfL) has asked you to study the feasibility of replacing the manned ticket offices with automated ticket machines in its underground stations. \n",
    "As a pilot study, TfL wants you to focus on the evening rush hour period, from 16:00 to 20:00, at a very small station with 1 employee at the ticket office, which will be replaced with 1 machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using historical data provided to you, you have determined that the time between customers arrivals at the ticket office/machine is exponentially distributed with a mean of 3.2 minutes. \n",
    "In addition, you have determined using this data that the service time (in minutes) at the manned ticket office can be modeled with a Gamma random variable with shape parameter 2 and scale parameter 1.3. \n",
    "Through its own studies, TfL has determined that the service time (in minutes) at the automated ticket machine can be modeled with a Gamma random variable with shape parameter 1 and scale parameter 2.6.\n",

Use the t-test for equal means to compare the mean average delay of the two systems. <span style=\"color:#a00000\">Use separate streams of random numbers to generate interarrival times and service times.</span>"
