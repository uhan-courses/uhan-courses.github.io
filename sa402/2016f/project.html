              Why is this study important?</li>
              <li>How do the authors model this system as a stochastic
              process? If they use a stochastic process model that we did not
              cover in class, provide an algorithmic description (using our
              general framework in Lesson 7).</li>
              <li>With their model, what assumptions do the authors make about
              the system they are studying? Do the authors validate these assumptions using
              data from the real-world system? Are these assumptions reasonable?
              Why or why not?</li>
              <li>What insights and conclusions do the authors draw from analyzing
              their model?</li>
              <li>How can the authors' model and analysis be improved?</li>

          <div class="nine columns">
            <p><strong>On reading:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reading a scientific article takes a lot of time. 
              <strong>Start early.</strong> 
              Don't let the relatively small page counts fool you.</li>
              <li>The math in research articles is often not cleanly presented 
              like in a textbook. You may need to seek some additional
              sources to fully understand what is going on &mdash; either by
              reading ahead in our textbook, or looking at other textbooks.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>On writing:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Your audience is your classmates.</strong>
              Your
              review should contain just enough detail so that any of your
              classmates can read it and get a good idea of what's going on in the
              article.</li>
              <li>Focus on making your review <strong>well-written and
              concise</strong>. Note: "concise" doesn't mean "without mathematical
              details."</li>
              <li>There is no minimum or maximum length for your review.</li>
              <li>Consider using <strong>section headings</strong> to make your review 
              easier to follow.</li>
              <li><strong>Proofread, proofread, proofread.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <strong>On citations:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Cite all your sources</strong> (at minimum, this should
              include the article you're reviewing). You can use whatever citation
              style you like (e.g. MLA, APA); just be consistent.</li>
              <li>It is customary in the scientific
              literature to simply refer to authors simply by their <strong>last names
              without titles</strong>. For example: "Uhan (2010) used
              a stationary Poisson process to ..."

            <ul>
              <li><strong>G1. Understanding the stochastic process model and assumptions.</strong> 
              I can describe how the article's authors model the real-world system they are 
              studying as a stochastic process. I can describe the assumptions they make about 
              the system, and discuss whether these assumptions are reasonable.</li>
              <li><strong>G2. Understanding the analysis of the stochastic process model.</strong> 
              I can describe the insights and conclusions that the article's authors draw from
              studying their model. I can offer meaningful suggestions on how the authors' 
              model can be improved.</li>
              <li><strong>G3. Technical writing.</strong>
              I can write a review that is clear, concise, and well-organized.</li>
