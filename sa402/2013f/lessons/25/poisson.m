clear all;

% Interval length
t = 500

% Number of points
n = 1000

% First, let's distribute n points uniformly along the interval [0,t].

% Next, let's compute the "gaps," or the distances between
% consecutive points along the interval.

% Let's get a histogram of these gaps. What does it look like?

% Let's confirm our suspicions.
