        <h2>Big Picture</h2>

        <h3>What will you be doing?</h3>
        <p>
          For this project, you will:
          <ul>
            <li>read an article in a research journal that uses a stochastic
            process to model and study a real-world system, and</li>
            <li>write a review of the article that summarizes and critiques the
            article's approach to studying the system.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>What's the point of this project?</h3>
        <p>By doing this project, I want you to:
          <ul>
            <li>discover an application of stochastic processes that you find
            interesting,</li>
            <li>gain some experience with reading scientific literature, and</li>
            <li>practice technical writing &mdash; a skill you will use well
            beyond your time at USNA.</li> 
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Who do you work with? When is the project due?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You must work in teams of 2 (one team may be just 1).</li>
          <li>A hard copy of your <strong>first draft</strong> is due in class
          on <strong>Tuesday November 19</strong>.</li>
          <li>I will make comments on your drafts and return them to you 
          on Tuesday November 26.</li>
          <li>A hard copy of your <strong>final draft</strong> is due in class
          on <strong>Thursday December 5</strong>.</li>
          <li>If you are finding your own article, you must get my approval by
          <strong>Thursday, October 31</strong>.
          In addition, please include a hard copy of your article when
          submitting your first and final drafts.</li>
        </ul>

          </ul>
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top:1.5em;">
          I chose these articles because 
          <ul>
            <li>they represent a wide range of applications, and</li>
            <li>you should be able to understand these articles with a
            reasonable amount of effort.</li> 
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Some of these articles will require reading ahead in the
        course.</p>

        <p>
          You are welcome to find your own article for this project. <a
            href="http://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> is a pretty
          good place to start. <strong>If you choose to find your own article,
            you must get my approval first (see above).</strong> 
        </p>

        <h3>What should you write in your review?</h3>
        <p>
          Your review should address the following:
          <ul>
            <li>What real-world system are the authors studying?
            Why is this study important?</li>
            <li>How do the authors model this system as a stochastic
            process? If they use a stochastic process model that we did not
            cover in class, provide an algorithmic description (using our
            general framework in Lesson 7).</li>
            <li>With their model, what assumptions do the authors make about
            the system they are studying? Are these assumptions reasonable?
            Why or why not?</li>
            <li>How do the authors validate their model using data from the
            real-world system, if they do at all?</li>
            <li>How can the authors' model be improved?</li>
            <li>What insights and conclusions do the authors draw from studying
            their model?</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Guidelines and suggestions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Reading a scientific article takes a lot of time. <strong>START
            EARLY.</strong> Don't let the relatively small page counts fool
          you. 
          
          The math in research articles is often not cleanly presented 
          like in a textbook. Furthermore, you may need to seek some additional
          sources to fully understand what is going on &mdash; either by
          reading ahead in our textbook, or looking at other textbooks.
          <li>Focus on making your review <strong>well-written and
            concise</strong>. Note: "concise" doesn't mean "no mathematical
          details." There is no minimum or maximum length for your review. Your
          review should contain just enough detail so that any of your
          classmates can read it and get a good idea of what's going on in the
          article.</li>
          <li><strong>Cite all your sources</strong> (at minimum, this should
          include the article you're reviewing). You can use whatever citation
          style you like (e.g. MLA, APA); just be consistent.</li>
          <li><strong>Proofread, proofread, proofread.</strong></li>
        </ul>

       <h3>How will you be graded?</h3>
       Your grade will be based on the following criteria:
       <ul>
         <li>Submitting a complete first draft (20%)</li>
         <li>Demonstrating a reasonable understanding of the article (20%)</li>
         <li>Addressing the questions above (20%)</li>
         <li>Writing clearly and concisely, and in a well-organized fashion (20%)</li>
         <li>Meaningfully revising and improving your first draft (20%)</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Credits</h3>
       <p>The idea for this project was borrowed from the course project
       for <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~levine/4740/">Math 4740 at
         Cornell.</a></p>
