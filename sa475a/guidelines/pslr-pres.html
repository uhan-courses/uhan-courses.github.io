        <ul>
          <li>8 January 2016 &mdash; Original version.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Your goal: give a 10-15 minute presentation that teaches your
        classmates about your capstone project problem and previous related
        work.
        This will also serve as practice for your final presentation at the end
        of the semester.</p>

        <h2>What should this presentation contain?</h2>

        <p>The content of your presentation should mimic your report to a
        certain extent:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Describe your problem and its significance.
            <ul>
              <li>Briefly provide some background for your problem, to give
              your audience some context before you describe your problem.</li> 
              <li>Describe your problem in words. Provide details about the objective function and constraints in your problem.</li>
              <li>Give an overview of how you propose to solve your problem.</li> 
              <li>Explain why studying your problem is important.
              What will a solution to your problem enable you to do?</li>
            </ul></li> 
            <li>Describe previous work related to your problem.
              <ul>
                <li>Who has studied related problems? How are these problems similar/different from yours?</li>
                <li>What approaches did they use? How are they similar/different from your proposed approach?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>You may find that you don't have enough time to present everything
        in your report. Select what you want to present carefully.</p>

        <h2>Other guidelines</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Each team member must give part of the presentation and be
          conversant on the whole presentation.</li>
          <li>The entire team must be at the front of the room during the
          entire presentation.</li>
          <li>Use PowerPoint slides (or something similar).
          <li>Prepare a handout for your audience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Suggestions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rehearse.</strong></li>
          <li><a href="academic_talk.pdf">Here</a> are slides from a
          presentation I gave a few years ago to graduate students in
          industrial engineering on giving an academic talk. 
          Since you're only presenting your problem statement and related
          literature, some of the tips may not be relevant this time around.
          However, you may find many of the other tips useful.</li>
        </ul>

       <h2>How will you be evaluated?</h2>
       <p>Your presentation will be evaluated based on the following criteria:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Demonstrating a reasonable understanding of the problem.</li>
         <li>Demonstrating a reasonable understanding of previous related work.</li>
         <li>Giving a clear, well-organized, presentation.</li>
       </ul>
