      <h1>Methodology and Results Report &mdash; Guidelines</h1>
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">SA475A Spring 2014</h3>

      <div class="block">
        <h4>Last updated:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>March 17, 2014 &mdash; Original version.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Your goal: write a report that</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>describes the methodology you developed and used to solve your
          capstone project problem, and</li>
          <li>describes and interprets the results you have obtained.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This will eventually form the bulk of the final capstone report you
        will submit at the end of the semester.</p>

        <h2>What should this report contain?</h2>

        <p>The best way to present your methodology and results will depend on the
        exact nature of your project. Your report should address the following in some
        shape or form. See <a href="#example">below</a> for examples.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Describe your problem mathematically. In particular:
            <ul>
              <li>Define all the input parameters to your problem as symbols.</li>
              <li>Explain what constitutes a feasible solution to your problem: i.e. describe the constraints.</li>
              <li>Describe the objective of your problem.</li>
            </ul></li> 
          <li>Describe your methodology for solving your problem. Some or all
          of the following may apply:
            <ul>
              <li>Describe how you collected and computed data for the problem
              (i.e. how did you come up with the numbers associated with all
              the input parameters you defined above?).</li>
              <li>Give a mathematical programming formulation (e.g. linear
              program, integer linear program) of your problem. Be sure to
              describe the meaning of each component of your formulation in
              words.</li>
              <li>Give pseudocode for the algorithms you wrote to solve your
              problem. If you have a lot of subroutines, a flowchart may be
              helpful.</li>
              <li>Describe the computing environment and the software that you
              used.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Discuss and interpret the results you obtained from carrying out your methodology.
              <span style="color:red;">For this report, discussing and
                interpreting preliminary results is OK.</span> 
              <ul>
                <li>According to your methodology, what is the solution to your
                problem? Don't just report raw numbers &mdash; what does the solution
                mean in the context of your problem?</li>
                <li>Carry out sensitivity analysis: how does your solution
                change when the input parameters change? Is your proposed
                solution robust or sensitive to these changes? What
                implications does this have in the context of your problem?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>References and citation style</h4>

        <p>Use the same citation style as the one you used for your problem
        statement and literature review:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>References should be listed in alphabetical order at the end of
          the report.</li>
          <li>List <strong>journal articles</strong> like this:
          <blockquote>
            <a class="tooltip" title="Author names: first and middle initials, then last name.">Y. Linde, A. Buzo and R.M. Gray</a>.
            <a class="tooltip" title="Article title, in sentence case.">An algorithm for vector quantizer design</a>.
            <a class="tooltip" title="Journal title, italicized."><em>IEEE Transactions on Communications</em></a>, 
            <a class="tooltip" title="Volume number(Issue number): Page numbers">28(1):84-95</a>,
            <a class="tooltip" title="Year of publication.">1980</a>. 
          </blockquote>
          <li>List <strong>books, pamphlets, and research reports</strong> like this:
          <blockquote>
            <a class="tooltip" title="Author names: first and middle initials, then last name. Indicate editor if applicable.">H. Abut, editor<a/>. 
            <a class="tooltip" title="Title of book, pamphlet, or research report.">Vector Quantization</a>. 
            <a class="tooltip" title="Publisher.">IEEE Press</a>,
            <a class="tooltip" title="Year of publication.">1990</a>.
          </blockquote></li>
          <li>List <strong>papers in a bound collection, such as conference proceedings</strong> like this:
          <blockquote>
            <a class="tooltip" title="Author names: first and middle initials, then last name.">M. Fanty, P. Schmid, and R. Cole.</a>
            <a class="tooltip" title="Paper title, in sentence case.">City name recognition over the telephone.</a>
            In <a class="tooltip" title="Title of bound collection.">Proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing</a>, 
            volume <a class="tooltip" title="Volume number.">1</a>, 
            pages <a class="tooltip" title="Page numbers.">549-552</a>, 
            <a class="tooltip" title="Location of conference, if applicable.">Minneapolis, U.S.A.</a>, 
            <a class="tooltip" title="Year of publication.">1993</a>. 
          </blockquote></li>
          <li>Refer to references by the authors' last names and year of
          publication in round brackets, like (Linde et al. 1980) or (Abut
          1990). If you want to refer to a specific page or result, you can do
          so like (Abut 1990, p. 51) or (Fanty et al. 1993, Figure 2.3).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Suggestions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a name="example"></a><strong>Examples:</strong> take a look at
          certain parts of <a href="scheduling-energy-aor.pdf">this article</a>
          to get an idea of what the language in your report should look like:
          in particular, look at Section 2 for an example of a mathematical
          problem description, Sections 3.1 and 3.2 for examples of presenting
          and explaining mathematical programming formulations, and Section 3.3
          for examples of algorithms in pseudocode and presenting results.</li>
          <li>As usual, focus on making your report organized and well-written.</li>
          <li>Also: <strong>proofread, proofread, proofread.</strong></li>
        </ul>

       <h2>How will you be evaluated?</h2>
       Your report will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
       <ul>
         <li>Submitting a complete draft</li>
         <li>Giving a complete and correct mathematical description of your problem</li>
         <li>Describing your methodology thoroughly</li>
         <li>Presenting the (preliminary) results you obtained from your methodology,
         and discussing and interpreting these results in a thoughtful manner</li>
         <li>Writing clearly, concisely, and eloquently, and in a well-organized fashion</li>
       </ul>
