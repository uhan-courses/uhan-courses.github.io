      <h1>Presentation &mdash; Problem Statement and Literature Review &mdash; Guidelines</h1>
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">SA475A Spring 2014</h3>

      <div class="block">
        <h4>Last updated:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>January 22, 2014 &mdash; Changed time constraints from 10-15 minutes to 10-12 minutes.</li> 
          <li>January 17, 2014 &mdash; Original version.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Your goal: give a 10-12 minute presentation that teaches your
        classmates about your capstone project problem and previous related
        work.
        This will also serve as practice for your final presentation at the end
        of the semester.</p>

        <h2>What should this presentation contain?</h2>

        <p>The content of your presentation should mimic your report to a
        certain extent:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Describe your problem.
            <ul>
              <li>Provide enough background so that your description of the problem makes sense to a reasonably general audience.</li> 
              <li>What are the issues you are studying?</li>
              <li>How will you solve these issues? &mdash; i.e. what approaches or techniques will you use?</li> 
            </ul></li> 
          <li>Explain why studying this problem is important.</li>
          <li>Review the literature: who has studied this problem,
          or similar problems, in the past? What were their approaches?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You may find that you don't have enough time to present everything
        in your report. Select what you want to present carefully.</p>

        <h2>Other guidelines</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Each team member must give part of the presentation and be
          conversant on the whole presentation.</li>
          <li>The entire team must be at the front of the room during the
          entire presentation.</li>
          <li>Use PowerPoint slides (or something similar).
          <li>Prepare a handout for your audience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Suggestions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rehearse.</strong></li>
          <li><a href="academic_talk.pdf">Here</a> are slides from a
          presentation I gave a few years ago to graduate students in
          industrial engineering on giving an academic talk. 
          Since you're only presenting your problem statement and related
          literature, some of the tips may not be relevant this time around.
          However, you may find many of the other tips useful.</li>
        </ul>

       <h2>How will you be evaluated?</h2>
       Your presentation will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
       <ul>
         <li>Demonstrating a reasonable understanding of the problem</li>
         <li>Demonstrating a reasonable understanding of previous related work</li>
         <li>Giving a clear, well-organized, presentation</li>
       </ul>
