      <h1>Final Report and Presentation &mdash; Guidelines</h1>
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">SA475A Spring 2014</h3>

      <div class="block">
        <h4>Last updated:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>April 8, 2014 &mdash; Original version.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your goals</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Write a <strong>report</strong> that describes your semester-long effort on your capstone project.</li>
          <li>Give a <strong>presentation</strong> to your peers and mathematics department faculty on your project.</li>
          <li>Create an attractive <strong>poster</strong> that shows off your awesome work to future visitors to Chauvenet Hall.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The report</h2>

        <p>You can find a template (with instructions) for your final capstone project report 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/usna.edu/document/d/1mV4m2sOdZigKRZUcXwv97J7OwrhRqLe2w4DDCAvISH8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

        <p>Take a look at the template. As you'll see, your final report will
        mostly consist of information from reports you have written earlier
        this semester. 
        
        <p>You should reuse language from your previous reports as you see fit.
        Make sure, however, that your final report is well-written and
        cohesive. You may have to refine or significantly edit parts of your
        previous reports.</p> 

        <h4>References and citation style</h4>

        <p>Use this citation style:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>References should be listed in alphabetical order at the end of
          the report.</li>
          <li>List <strong>journal articles</strong> like this:
          <blockquote>
            <a class="tooltip" title="Author names: first and middle initials, then last name.">Y. Linde, A. Buzo and R.M. Gray</a>.
            <a class="tooltip" title="Article title, in sentence case.">An algorithm for vector quantizer design</a>.
            <a class="tooltip" title="Journal title, italicized."><em>IEEE Transactions on Communications</em></a>, 
            <a class="tooltip" title="Volume number(Issue number): Page numbers">28(1):84-95</a>,
            <a class="tooltip" title="Year of publication.">1980</a>. 
          </blockquote>
          <li>List <strong>books, pamphlets, and research reports</strong> like this:
          <blockquote>
            <a class="tooltip" title="Author names: first and middle initials, then last name. Indicate editor if applicable.">H. Abut, editor<a/>. 
            <a class="tooltip" title="Title of book, pamphlet, or research report.">Vector Quantization</a>. 
            <a class="tooltip" title="Publisher.">IEEE Press</a>,
            <a class="tooltip" title="Year of publication.">1990</a>.
          </blockquote></li>
          <li>List <strong>papers in a bound collection, such as conference proceedings</strong> like this:
          <blockquote>
            <a class="tooltip" title="Author names: first and middle initials, then last name.">M. Fanty, P. Schmid, and R. Cole.</a>
            <a class="tooltip" title="Paper title, in sentence case.">City name recognition over the telephone.</a>
            In <a class="tooltip" title="Title of bound collection.">Proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing</a>, 
            volume <a class="tooltip" title="Volume number.">1</a>, 
            pages <a class="tooltip" title="Page numbers.">549-552</a>, 
            <a class="tooltip" title="Location of conference, if applicable.">Minneapolis, U.S.A.</a>, 
            <a class="tooltip" title="Year of publication.">1993</a>. 
          </blockquote></li>
          <li>Refer to references by the authors' last names and year of
          publication in round brackets, like (Linde et al. 1980) or (Abut
          1990). If you want to refer to a specific page or result, you can do
          so like (Abut 1990, p. 51) or (Fanty et al. 1993, Figure 2.3).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The presentation</h2>

        <p>In your presentation, you will teach your audience about your
        capstone project.
        Your presentation should be 15-20 minutes long.</p>

        <p>The content of your presentation should mimic your report to a
        certain extent:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Describe your problem, with some background information.</li>
          <li>Explain why studying this problem is important.</li>
          <li>Briefly review the related literature.</li>
          <li>Describe your methodology (e.g. models, algorithms, data collection and preparation)</li> 
          <li>Describe your results and sensitivity analysis.</li>
          <li>Describe your conclusions and lessons learned.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Select what you want to present carefully: remember that 
        you'll be speaking to a fairly general audience who is not as familiar
        with your project as you are.</p>

        <p><a href="academic_talk.pdf">Here</a> are some tips on giving an
        academic talk that you may find useful.</a></p>

        <h4>Other guidelines</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Each team member must give part of the presentation and be
          conversant on the whole presentation.</li>
          <li>The entire team must be at the front of the room during the
          entire presentation.</li>
          <li>Use PowerPoint slides (or something similar).
        </ul>

        <h2>The poster</h2>

        <p>You can find a very rudimentary template for your poster <a
          href="poster-template.pptx">here</a>. Please use this PowerPoint template
          instead of Google Drive &mdash; this PowerPoint template has the
          right settings for poster printing.</p>

        <p>Think of your poster as a "visual summary" of your project. You
        should be able to borrow heavily from your paper and presentation
        slides. Make sure to include some visuals &mdash; photos, diagrams,
        screenshots, graphs &mdash; that illustrate different aspects of your project.
        Also, feel free to play with the color scheme and make the poster
        attractive (but also professional). Take a look around the 3rd deck of
        Chauvenet to get some ideas.</p>
