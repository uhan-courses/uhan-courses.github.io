      <h1>Final Report and Presentation &mdash; Guidelines</h1>
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">SA475A Spring 2015</h3>

      <div class="block">
        <h4>Last updated:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>8 April 2015 &mdash; Final report template updated.</li>
          <li>22 December 2014 &mdash; Original version.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your goals</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Write a <strong>report</strong> that describes your semester-long effort on your capstone project.</li>
          <li>Give a <strong>presentation</strong> to your peers and mathematics department faculty on your project.</li>
          <li>Create an attractive <strong>poster</strong> that shows off your awesome work to future visitors of Chauvenet Hall.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The report</h2>

        <p>You can find a template (with instructions) for the final capstone
        report 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/usna.edu/document/d/12osiESEW2XsJM5XUydxlXT5LVb-Txw8RV7HxgNWS_4E/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Take a look at the template. As you'll see, your final report will
        mostly consist of information from reports you have written earlier
        this semester. 
        
        <p>You should reuse language from your previous reports as you see fit.
        Make sure, however, that your final report is well-written and
        cohesive. You may have to refine or significantly edit parts of your
        previous reports.</p> 

        <h3>References and citations</h3>

        <p>Use <a href="ref.html">this</a> reference and citation style guide.</p>

        <h2>The presentation</h2>

        <p>In your presentation, you will teach your audience about your
        capstone project.
        Your presentation should be 10-15 minutes long.</p>

        <p>The content of your presentation should mimic your report to a
        certain extent:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Describe your problem, with some background information.</li>
          <li>Explain why studying this problem is important.</li>
          <li>Briefly review the related literature.</li>
          <li>Describe your methodology (e.g. models, algorithms, data collection and preparation).</li> 
          <li>Describe your results and sensitivity analysis.</li>
          <li>Describe your conclusions and lessons learned.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Select what you want to present carefully: remember that 
        you'll be speaking to a fairly general audience who is not as familiar
        with your project as you are.</p>

        <p><a href="academic_talk.pdf">Here</a> are some tips on giving an
        academic talk that you may find useful.</a></p>

        <h4>Other guidelines</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Each team member must give part of the presentation and be
          conversant on the whole presentation.</li>
          <li>The entire team must be at the front of the room during the
          entire presentation.</li>
          <li>Use PowerPoint slides (or something similar).
        </ul>

        <h2>The poster</h2>

        <p>You can find a very rudimentary template for your poster <a
          href="poster-template.pptx">here</a>. Please use this PowerPoint template
          instead of Google Slides&mdash; this PowerPoint template has the
          right settings for poster printing.</p>

        <p>Think of your poster as a "visual summary" of your project. You
        should be able to borrow heavily from your paper and presentation
        slides. Make sure to include some visuals &mdash; photos, diagrams,
        screenshots, graphs &mdash; that illustrate different aspects of your project.
        Also, feel free to play with the color scheme and make the poster
        attractive (but also professional). Take a look around the 3rd deck of
        Chauvenet to get some ideas.</p>
